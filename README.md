# Testing

- The project was checked that it works on all screen sizes
- When you register a user name and password are saved in a data file
- If you have not registered yet, you are not allowed to login
- When you add a recipe, the recipe, recipe image, and detail are saved in the data file
- When the recipe is edit, the categories are edit in the data file as well
- When the recipe or categories are deleted, they are deleted from the data file
- Checked the code of the site it works perfectly and without any errors and was also used as a project user has been added, edit, delete and read recipes and categories very smoothly
- I made a great effort to check the project and did not encounter any error
